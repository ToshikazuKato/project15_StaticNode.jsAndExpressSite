# project15_StaticNode.jsAndExpressSite

Description : 

  In this project, you'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects you've built. The site will   contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator         pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five         projects from this Techdegree.

Exceeds Expectations :

  1. "npm start" runs app.js by setting "scripts : { "start" : "node app.js" }" in package.json.
  
  2. Display the error.message, error.status, and error.stack properties by using error handling middleware for a non-existent      route. Check error.pug.
  
  3. Add myStyle.css to customize the style. Font, background color, transition(hover effect) have been added.
